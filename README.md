# Decision Region Analysis for Generalizability (DRAG) of AI models: Estimating model generalizability in the case of cross-reactivity and population shift
## Regulatory Science Tool
Prediction model deployment of virtual images generated from vicinal distribution provides smooth decision region transitions between various subgroups. This RST is used to analyze the compositions of these decision regions for many subgroups to provide insight into the how well they are represented in the data and the discontinuity of subgroup decision regions leading to incorrect predictions.

### Purpose
Understanding an artificial intelligence (AI) model's ability to generalize to its target population is critical to ensure the safe and effective use of AI in medical devices. Traditional generalizability assessment relies on the availability of large, diverse data sets, which are difficult to obtain for medical imaging. We present an approach for enhanced generalizability assessment by examining the decision space beyond the available test set.
